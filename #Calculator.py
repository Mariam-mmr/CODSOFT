#Calculator
#This program is a simple calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
#It perform the calculation for two numbers and display the result

#Function Definitions for Basic Arithmetic Operations
#The first operation...Adding two numbers
def add(x,y):
    return x+y
#The second operation...Subtracting two numbers
def sub(x,y):
    return x-y
#The third operation...Multiplying two numbers
def mul(x,y):
    return x*y
#The fourth operation...Dividing two numbers
def div(x,y):
    #Handling the case of division by zero
    if y == 0:
        return "Error! Division by zero."
    #If y != 0, then the division is defined
    else:
        return x/y


#The main function to execute the calculator

        #for "try" block if everything runs without error, the code continues to execute normally.
        #the try block is attempting to convert the userâ€™s input into floating-point numbers using float().
        #This is necessary because input() returns data as a string, and you need to convert it to a numerical type for arithmetic operations.
        try:
            num1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
            num2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))

#The script now defined all the functions but will not execute the calculator program
#Now we need to call our "main()" function, wich contains the logic to work
#Directly call the main function to interact with the user and perform calculations
